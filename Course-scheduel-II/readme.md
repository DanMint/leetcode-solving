The first code that i pushed (first.cpp) was the code that i came up without thinking much about the style and the amount of time that it would take for the program.
My main goal was to make the program work and work it did. After the code that i have written got accepted by the compiler I imidiately started optimizing the code.
The second code that i pushed was optimized bit hence it ran abit faster how ever i managed to optimize the code once again called finalOptimization.cpp which ran 
94% faster from all the submissions.
